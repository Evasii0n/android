Illusion
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/Illusion, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Illusion trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Illusion2/android.git -b lp5.0
